							<h3><a href="episodes.html">#002: Why we brewing LMAO</a></h3>
							<p>We wanted to give a little context as to how we met and how this podcast came to be! This is a project we've been talking about for a while, so we wanted to discuss why we felt making a podcast would be a good avenue for us, and perhaps encourage others to do the same! You should be warned though, the stories are quite a rollercoaster.. buckle up lmao.</p>

							<h3><a href="episodes.html">#003: the quarter-life crisis</a></h3>
							<p>Your hosts are unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how u think of this) newly-turned 20-year-olds... and we have a lot to say. We'll pour our hearts out about the lessons we've learned, memories we've made, and the dreams we're chasing. This episode is equal parts introspective and irrelevant, but we hope you enjoy :)

							<p>We grew up on opposite sides of the world--When both of us are home, one of us is going to sleep when the other is waking up. Though we grew up in completely different cultures that have shaped our trains of thought, our similarites ultimately brought us together for the better, and we wanted to talk about the nuances such situations and how rare it is to find the people for you.</p>
