			<h3> Yamila <br> pronouns: she/her <br> Integrated Design and Media <br> <br>Hello! It's nice to meet everyone, I hope everyone enjoys the podcast:) Just wanted to tell a few things about myself! I grew up in northern Utah, and I think it's definitely influenced my love for hiking, biking, and running. In my free time I also love to sketch, read, and listen to music! (Beabadoobee, Faye Webster, Laufey, and Blood Orange are some of my favorite artists!)<br> </h3>
